# heart-felt
> feel your heart!

The initial platform would be web based, requiring users to have a webcam and to also have a chromium enabled browser (for all the web3 stuff). The idea is to frame and create it as a public good, ie, the platform is primarily for the users' benefit, and if they choose to, they reward us, in our case, with being a participant in some study. Note that this is a departure from current web2 norms of having personal motives be acted upon by default. Hence, *public goods*.

Web3 ethos and integration does not end there however. For a large enough study it might make sense for it to become a full fledged dApp where the results of the study are beneficial in some way for any potential user. In our case, this can be to help meditate by detecting the heartbeat as a form of meditation through action. To that end, eventually, the platform would reward participants by mined tokens, to [somewhat] compensate them for their time and attention. Note that the real [perceived] compensation should always be the effects of the heart detection tests, and not making [quick] money.

For the first version, the aim is to effectively put the current software online with minimal changes. The other flub around the core software is to create a base for a larger platform, which is composed of modular already-solved problems. So, the components can be picked up and quickly* implemented with minor adjustments to fit our platform / direction.

## sketch description

The home page and the landing page are the same. There are a few clicks that the user can perform on here,
1. [`FEEL NOW`](./pages/now/README.md) This lets the user to casually do the heart-detection and heart-counting tests. Or [meditate](./pages/meditate/)*.
2. [`Shuffle`](./pages/rando/README.md) This is where the user can sync their heart beat with a random stranger on the internet.
  - To draw attention to this we can simply add the number of folks online to the top right of the shuffle-icon button.
  - In default case, we display it like that on hover.
3. [`user`](./pages/account/README.md) This either leads to the browser wallet opening up, or the account page (if connected and unlocked).
4. [`trial`](./pages/trial/README.md) This is where we conduct the study. Disclaimer and all.
5. [`theory`](./pages/theory/README.md) Here we explain the concepts, but in the style of [telescopic text](https://www.telescopictext.org/). This will allow us to track which parts of the theory the users find more interesting / difficult.

## potential entity
> Heart Felt Productions Inc.

I have been thinking about this for a bit, and this name really sticks. It is also appropriate since we are feeling our hearts and it is a heart-felt endeavour. From this basic proof of concept dApp based study, two different projects may emerge,

### dApp Ideas
> A non fungible way to crowdsource questioning

Most trivially, this can be an extension such that anyone can conduct studies and get participants easily. Something of the kind already mentioned before. Also see [this page](https://dappideas.art/).

More interestingly, this can be a platform where studys can happen *and* the results of the studies benefits others in some way. So, a more dApp based approach wherein the rersearchers come in for conducting a study, and the platform handles the wrapping it into a dApp.

### Semicolon Fingers
> Mint [heartwarming] stories with a semicolon tattoo as NFTs

As mentioned earlier, this is a story telling platform which can benefit from the heart detection being a precursor to writing (or even reading). This is somehwat loosely related to the study / task / dApp at hand.

#### Inner Engineering

Finally, the idea here is to use a combination of interospection, traditional teachings, and modern science to enable users to be more deliberate and effective in their lives. This is a much larger project, with a lot of variability, but would be fun to do.
