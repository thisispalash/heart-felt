# `/trial`
> this is where we conduct our study

This page will be quite similar to the current UI. One change could be the visual feedback that is provided. I am partial to a beating heart, which would be cooler if it looked like a real heart, but I am unable to draw that well.

Participating with the study would entail certain data policies, which need to be ironed out. The user should be made well aware of this fact. This would also go into their casual activities, even if that data is just used to verify authenticity of participant. More broadly it can be used to give a more detailed picture of the participant.

The session would have 32/64 trials, this high since now it is intrinsically motivated, or at least what the goal of the platform is (by having casual / meditation be the main attraction / pull). Moreover, I think a significant sample is considered to be 30+ trials and the power of two is just vanity. We can just as easily do 37. or 42. Finally, owing to the large sample size, we could see what the optimal number of trials are.

Upon completion, the users are presented with their accuracy, which trials they got right / wrong, *and* also their change in heart rate. We must be careful to not have this displayed during trial since that would be another form of visual feedback, so only after. The users can of course share this summary.
