# `/rando`
> Pair with random strangers and sync your beat

There are a few ways this can go,
- [ ] Perform the sync/async test by translating it to own/their heartbeats.
- [ ] Allow users to sync their hearts with each other using the feedback described in [syncing heartbeat](../now/README.md#syncing-heartbeat).
- [ ] Some kind of heartbeat counting task instead of detection.

Some more thought is required for this portion of the platform. At the end of course, there will be a share element possible, where we can do interesting things like share if only both agree, or a multi-sig transaction, etc.
