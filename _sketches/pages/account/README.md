# `/account`
> a wallet address is the account

This is where the user can see their activity on our platform. Section descriptions below.

## wallet
> standard web3 wallet connect button

User login and authentication is tied to their wallet addresses. This may become a problem, especially if we want our users to depend on the address (at least for some time while they develop the requisite tools), and we can potentially [decentralize the entire platform](https://zeronet.io/) so the user can do everything locally, or look at [Account Abstraction](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4337), or both.

## user picture
> a generative NFT, generated from user activity

The picture can be the standard user-icon, but in 3D and colours can be used to denote certain aspects like accuracy, frequency, etc. More deliberation needed for the specifics, but as a general idea, of generative a colourful 3D user-icon, it should be done. This could also play into better branding for the platform.

About NFTs, one true use case is for profile pictures. On the current internet, you upload your pictures everywhere independently and the platforms also save them for a long time. Here, you own the image but it is public (ie, you'd likely put some thought into the image as well) and as a consequence, everyone can use this image on their platforms without your intervention. Using NFTs also positions us for the next hype, so much so, that we must be careful not to get swayed / off course by it (specifically, NFT prices). One option is to make these NFTs [Soul Bound](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-5114) (ie, non transferrable).

## data display
> standard dashboard of user activity (trials, randoms, meditations*)

A typical data screen so the user may view their activity on the platform. The sections that make sense are trials, random pairings, and meditations (when available).

## footer

The standard footer should be displayed here. Currently, that includes home, trial, and theory, but perhaps other links would make more sense. One reason for just using home was to associate the account page with account activities and the homepage for platform activities. Effectively sending a message to the user that *you chose to do this now, so do this now and nothing else*.

Pages to consider,
- home
- trial
- theory
- now
- meditate
- random
