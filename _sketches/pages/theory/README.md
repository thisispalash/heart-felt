This would be displayed using [telescopic text](https://www.telescopictext.org/). One advantage of using such a form is that we can track where the user clicked (and in how much time, etc.). The link tracking can be used to see which parts of the theory users find interesting or challenging. Effectively, users will soon enough have multiple diverging paths they can take and them taking a specific one informs us. I imagine interesting and challenging can be distinguished by the rate of clicks.

## a fun addition
> skills do not currently permit however

A fun addition could be to somehow imbibe a feeling of discovery using this form of expanding text. One trivial way could be an infinte pan (and zoom) where the entire text is contained as a graph and the user hovers over it, reading whatever is in focus, clicking around to expand / change focus. Note, trivial in idea, not in implementation.
